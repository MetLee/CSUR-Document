# Getting started 

This tutorial will give you a quick introduction to the CSUR road system and walk you through its key features and use cases.

## Before you start
### What is CSUR?
CSUR (Cities: Skylines Urban Road) is a road building system developed for the game Cities: Skylines. CSUR helps players to more efficiently build realistic road infrastructures and massive road networks. If you are familar with the Metro Overhaul Mod (MOM), then CSUR is to some extent the road counterpart of MOM and is much more complex than MOM because of the great diversity in road network compared to metro networks. Since CSUR is its own independent system, you may even build your city completely with CSUR.

### Do I need CSUR?
CSUR has its unique modular design which pre-builts lane transitions and ramps into road assets. Therefore, all lane markings are pre-built into these assets, and perfectly smooth road connections can be made in one shot. Besides the modular road assets which comprise the majority of more than 6000 assets in the entire CSUR collection, there are also a variety of regular roads which can be used just like the vanilla roads. You can either use CSUR as an addon to your existing road asset collection just as other roads, or enjoy the modular design unique to CSUR to build ultra-detailed interchanges. Compared with the vanilla road system, CSUR undoubtedly takes some time to learn. However if you are keen on detailing your city, using CSUR will save lots of time placing lane markings and other props, with a bonus of being harder to hit the game prop limit.

## Contents and Installation
[This Steam Workshop collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1959216109) contains the full asset and mod list used by CSUR. Because the way CSUR roads are made is dramaticaly different from any other road asset on the Workshop, **the contents for the CSUR road system includes a combination of different both assets and mods**. Let's go over the items in the collection before installing CSUR.

|![CSUR Loader](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/784123877863725888/419D8D12F3C11E907B08EFB753333A54837B54CB/?imw=100&imh=100&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true) | CSUR Loader | **REQUIRED** Mod | **Core utility mod for all CSUR roads.** All CSUR road assets share the same textures, so the texture is conatined externally using this mod instead of repeating them over and over again in each asset. This mod also contains some CSUR road props such as elevated road lights and median fillers. | 
|![CSUR Toolbox](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/771739225863915879/512F52C4A13BF4402D3A82124B68681674D7BF3E/?imw=100&imh=100&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true) | CSUR Toolbox | **REQUIRED** Mod for M-series road packs | **Provides a lane-based road selection UI for modular CSUR roads and modifies some of the game mechanics for modular roads to work properly.** The base game's traffic and road building mechanics is unable to support all the features in the CSUR system.|

All roads in these packs can directly connect to other roads and create intersections. They also offer some of the exclusive features of CSUR to quickly create realistic intersections. To ensure compatibility with modular roads, these roads cannot create intersection in elevated and tunnel modes, and there will be blue clipping holes if they are connected to roads in the Large Road (vanilla six-lane road) category.|

In contrast to the vanilla road system, CSUR adopts a fundamentally different idea of road building, that is, on a "lane-by-lane" basis. Instead of being a complete stretch of road, **each modular road asset in CSUR represent a combination of lanes**. These combinations can be opening/closing of lanes, moving lanes inwards/outwards, or forking/merging at ramps. These modular roads cannot create intersections so they need to be used together with the R-series packs.|

After the pillar pack is replaced, the pillars on CSUR roads in your savegame will be automatically updated to the new pillars as long as they have not been detached from the road using Move It. |
