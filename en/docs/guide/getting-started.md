# Getting started 

This tutorial will give you a quick introduction to the CSUR road system and walk you through its key features and use cases.

## Meet CSUR
### What is CSUR?
CSUR (Cities: Skylines Urban Road) is a road building system developed for the game Cities: Skylines. CSUR helps players to more efficiently build realistic road infrastructures and massive road networks. If you are familar with the Metro Overhaul Mod (MOM), then CSUR is to some extent the road counterpart of MOM and is much more complex than MOM because of the great diversity in road network compared to metro networks. Since CSUR is its own independent system, you may even build your city completely with CSUR.

### Do I need CSUR?
CSUR has its unique modular design which pre-builts lane transitions and ramps into road assets. Therefore, all lane markings are pre-built into these assets, and perfectly smooth road connections can be made in one shot. Besides the modular road assets which comprise the majority of more than 6000 assets in the entire CSUR collection, there are also a variety of regular roads which can be used just like the vanilla roads. You can use CSUR as an addon to your existing road asset collection just as other roads, or enjoy the modular design unique to CSUR to build ultra-detailed interchanges. 



Compared with the vanilla road system, CSUR undoubtedly takes some time to learn. However if you are keen on detailing your city, using CSUR will save lots of time placing lane markings and other props, with a bonus of being harder to hit the game prop limit.
